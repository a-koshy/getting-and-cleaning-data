# getting-and-cleaning-data

This repository contains the coursework for Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 project:

 1. The [tidy version](tidy_data.txt) of the data set.
 2. The R script that created it: [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)
 3. [CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md), which describes the variables, the data, and the work I did to clean the data.
 4. The [second data set](averages.txt), a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 5. This [README](README.md) file.


To reproduce my results:

1. Download the data set from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). 
2. Extract it in the same directory as [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) and run run_analysis.R. Read the [CodeBook](CodeBook.md) for more information on what run_analysis.R does.
3. The two data sets produced are this [tidy version](tidy_data.txt) of the original and this independent tidy [data set](averages.txt) of averages. CodeBook.md has more information on these data sets.
